# General:
### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?
`I spend two sessions of 3-4 hours to complete this test. I had very little experience on React.js. I spend the first session to go through some online tutorials and exercises, and second session to complete the test.>`
### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
`1) Setup server and bring the app online.`

`2) Add login functionality.`

`3) Add search engine to accept user input.`

`4) Setup db to store user credentials and booking details.`
### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
`I am really glad I could complete the test in short period of time. As mentioned, I had few experience on React.js. I planed to complete the test using traditional css and html initially, but I always want to try React.js in the past and realized this might be a perfect chance to start.`
### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
`I spend quite sometime to config the system and to setup the environment and spend most of the time to figure out the syntax of React.js and structure of the app written in React.js. The most different part for me to complete this test the to get use to write functionalities under react framework and it's getting slightly easier when I am used to it.`
### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
`This test the quite comprehensive on testing react skill. But it's relatively easy for the candidates who had react or js background.`
